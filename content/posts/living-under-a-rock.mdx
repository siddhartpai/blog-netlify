Today, I decided I'll start to w[](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/)rite again. 

For me, writing and publishing something had it's own pain points. I hated wordpress for it being too heavy. I wanted something light like Jekyll ; A static website, however with a CMS. 

Setting up Netlify CMS is a breeze; You can go [here](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/) and set it up with a click. 

The only issue I faced with netlify was the first invite link is a broken user flow. 

`https://your-website/#invite_token=fhJJSEncSJK980NJmdsJls` should be 

`https://your-website/admin/#invite_token=fhJJSEncSJK980NJmdsJls` 



My next post would be about my shortcuts and ways about the terminal; Stay tuned.
